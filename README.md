# 🧩 15 Puzzle AI Algorithm Visualizer

This project transforms a traditional **AI algorithm comparison problem** into an **interactive visual web application** using the **15 Puzzle** as a case study.

Instead of limiting AI algorithms to console-based outputs, this application **visualizes algorithm behavior, efficiency, and performance**, making complex AI concepts easier to understand.

## 🎯 Objective

- Convert AI search algorithms into a **visual learning experience**
- Compare algorithm **efficiency, speed, and performance**
- Bridge the gap between **theoretical AI concepts and real-world applications**

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 🔹 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores states level by level
- Guarantees **optimal solution**
- High **memory consumption**
- Slower for complex puzzle states

### 🔹 Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores deeply before backtracking
- Lower memory usage
- Does **not guarantee optimal solution**
- Can fail in deep or infinite spaces

### 🔹 A* Search (Heuristic-based)
- Uses **Manhattan Distance heuristic**
- Guarantees **optimal solution**
- Highly efficient in time and memory
- Best-performing algorithm for this problem
